# NLP_Paraphrasing_and_NER_of_Abridged_Abstract_from_Research_Papers

NLP Paraphrasing and NER of Abridged Abstract from Research Papers is a process of extracting key information from research papers and 
summarizing it in a concise and informative way. This can be done using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as paraphrasing 
and named entity recognition (NER). Paraphrasing involves rewriting the text of a research paper in a different way, while NER involves 
identifying and extracting named entities from text, such as people, organizations, and places. By combining these techniques,
it is possible to create a concise and informative summary of a research paper that can be easily understood by a wide audience.
